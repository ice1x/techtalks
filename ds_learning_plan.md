# Data Science Learning Plan

## 1. Descriptive Statistics
### Overview
Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and organizing data to describe its main features. This area focuses on methods for summarizing data using measures of central tendency, dispersion, and graphical representations.

### Topics to Cover
- **Measures of Central Tendency**
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode

- **Measures of Dispersion**
  - Range
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)

- **Shape of Distributions**
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis

- **Graphical Representations**
  - Histograms
  - Box Plots
  - Bar Charts
  - Pie Charts

- **Data Types and Scales of Measurement**
  - Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio scales

### Learning Resources
- Books: *Statistics for Business and Economics* by Paul Newbold
- Online Courses: Descriptive Statistics module on Khan Academy
- Practice: Analyze datasets using Python libraries like `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`

## 2. Probability Theory
### Overview
Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability, the analysis of random phenomena. The main goal is to understand how likely events are to occur.

### Topics to Cover
- **Basic Probability Concepts**
  - Experiments, Sample Space, and Events
  - Axioms of Probability
  - Conditional Probability
  - Independent and Dependent Events

- **Probability Distributions**
  - Discrete Distributions: Binomial, Poisson
  - Continuous Distributions: Normal, Exponential, Uniform

- **Bayes' Theorem**
  - Concept of Prior, Likelihood, and Posterior
  - Applications of Bayes’ Theorem

- **Law of Large Numbers**
  - Understanding the theorem and its implications

- **Central Limit Theorem**
  - Importance in statistical inference

### Learning Resources
- Books: *Introduction to Probability* by Dimitri P. Bertsekas and John N. Tsitsiklis
- Online Courses: Probability courses on Coursera or edX
- Practice: Solve probability problems using Python’s `Scipy` and `Numpy`

## 3. Inferential Statistics
### Overview
Inferential statistics allows us to make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.

### Topics to Cover
- **Sampling and Sampling Distributions**
  - Types of Sampling Methods
  - The Concept of a Sampling Distribution

- **Hypothesis Testing**
  - Null and Alternative Hypotheses
  - Type I and Type II Errors
  - p-Values and Significance Levels
  - T-tests (One-sample, Two-sample, Paired)
  - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
  - Chi-Square Tests

- **Confidence Intervals**
  - Constructing Confidence Intervals for Means and Proportions
  - Interpreting Confidence Intervals

- **Correlation and Regression Analysis**
  - Pearson and Spearman Correlation Coefficients
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Regression Analysis

- **Non-parametric Tests**
  - When and how to use non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test

### Learning Resources
- Books: *The Elements of Statistical Learning* by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman
- Online Courses: Inferential Statistics on Udacity
- Practice: Perform hypothesis tests and regression analysis using Python’s `Statsmodels` and `Scipy`

### Additional Tips
- Work on projects that involve real-world datasets to apply these concepts.
- Participate in online forums or study groups to discuss and solve statistical problems.
- Regularly review and practice the concepts to build a strong foundation.
